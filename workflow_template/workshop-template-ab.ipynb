    "Antibody design has grown into one of the fastest growing branches in the pharmaceutical industry. Antibodies promise extremely high specificity and the ability to use the body’s own immune system to kill e.g. tumors, however  their size and complexity make their computational design challenging. \n",

    "An antibody is a large protein that generally works by attaching itself to an antigen, which is a unique site of the pathogen. The binding harnesses the immune system to directly attack and destroy the pathogen. Antibodies can be highly specific while showing low immunogenicity, which is achieved by their unique structure. **The fragment crystallizable region (Fc region**) activates the immune response and is species specific, i.e. human Fc region should not evoke an immune response in humans.  **The fragment antigen-binding region (Fab region**) needs to be highly variable to be able to bind to antigens of various nature (high specificity).  The terminal (antigen recognising) domain of the Fab region is caleld **the variable domain (Fv domain)**.\n",

    "We prepared a sample HADDOCK `json` file that one can submit to the [Submit file interface](https://bianca.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/submit_file) of HADDOCK2.4. First one needs to register  for all HADDOCK services [https://bianca.science.uu.nl/auth/register/](https://bianca.science.uu.nl/auth/register/). Then we will modify the `json` file with a few available scripts to update it with our newly created pdb. In this case we use ambiguous restraints created from the reference crystal structure (PDB ID [3RVW](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3RVW)). They were defined based on the true interface (all residues within 3.9Å from the other protein) and are also located in `data/input/ambig.tbl`.  If one wishes to replace them too, there is a script `data/script/replace_tbl.py` which updates the restraint as well. Here one needs to specify which type of restraints they want to replace (`-type (ambig,unambig,hbond,dihedral)`). In this scenario we are using increased sampling such that each antibody conformer is used in 100 model for it0 - rigid body docking. In this case we have an ensemble of 12 conformers, thus 1200 structures geenrated in it0 (`structures_0`). Further, we increase sampling from 200 to 400 per it1 (`structures_1`) and it1 water (`waterrefine`) and in the analysis part (`anastruc_1`) too. These changes are already included in the sample `json` file, thus do not need to be modified manually.   \n",
